# My Neighborhood Map
## Udacity FEND project 5
## Readme

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a neighborhood map with the locations of at least five interesting places. The app must be single page and the locations must be shown as markers on the map and items in a list.

We chose our home town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. 

### Libraries
 - We used [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) as the framework around which the app is created. We used it for it's simplicity, nice layout and object graphics.
 - We used [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) as the *Model-View-ViewModel* implementation framework.
  
### APIs
 - We used the [Foursquare API](http://api.foursquare.com/) for extracting addresses for our locations.
 - We used the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) for the map
